The relay now runs a WebSocket heartbeat (ping/pong, 30s) over every socket and terminates one that misses a pong window, so dead agent/browser/stream sockets (Wi-Fi loss, sleep, cable pull) are detected promptly instead of lingering until the TCP timeout. Termination reuses the existing close cleanup, evicting stale sessions and clearing the duplicate "Stale" card.
