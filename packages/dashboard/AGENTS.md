# dashboard — AGENTS.md

> Common rules: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) | Full index: [INDEX.md](../../INDEX.md)

## Design Reference

Before any design or frontend work, read **[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** and follow the color tokens, typography, and elevation rules defined there.

## WHAT

React SPA team dashboard: provides the simulator viewer, build comments, and team invite screens.
The audience is the whole team (PO, PM, designers, backend, QA) — not just QA. See root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for the two testing modes (manual vs. AI Agent via MCP).
**No standalone deployment** — bundled to `dist/` via `vite build`, then copied to the relay package's `public/` directory and served directly by the relay server.

### App Center Structure

`/app-center` route. Left app list sidebar + center Release Accordion + Build cards.

- **App sidebar**: `GET /api/v1/apps` → selecting an app manages state via `?appId=N` URL parameter.
- **Release Accordion**: `GET /api/v1/builds?app_id=N` → grouped by `version_name` (`groupByRelease()`). No dedicated `releases` table — UI grouping uses `version_name` metadata.
- **Build card**: shows `build_number`, `platform`, `status_label`, uploader, `uploaded_at`. Inline status dropdown. **"Start QA" CTA** → `/app-center/build?id={build_id}`.
- **Upload**: `UploadBuildDialog` — iOS `.app.zip` or `.tar.gz`/`.tgz` (EAS simulator build) / Android `.apk`. `version_name` / `build_number` are auto-extracted from plist, so no manual input fields.

## HOW

- **Stack**: Vite + React 19 + React Router v7 + Shadcn/Tailwind + next-themes
- **Structure**: `src/` — app entry, router, pages; `components/` — shared components; `hooks/` — custom hooks; `lib/` — utils, types, API client
- **Routing**: `BrowserRouter`-based. `/login` and `/invite` are public. Everything else is protected by `DashboardLayout` via `useAuth` (redirects to `/login`).
- **Auth**: Session confirmed via `GET /api/v1/auth/me`. HttpOnly cookie (not readable from JS).
- **Streaming**: set `binaryType = 'arraybuffer'` in `useRelay`, branch on `e.data instanceof ArrayBuffer` for binary frames.
- **Dev server proxy**: `vite.config.ts` proxies `/api` and `/uploads` → `http://localhost:4000`.
- **Build order**: dashboard first → relay second (`agent-core → dashboard → relay`).

## Testing

- `pnpm test` is always run foreground (terminal). **Never run vitest as a background process** — worker forks accumulate as zombies and exhaust CPU/RAM.
- If a test appears to hang, Ctrl+C immediately and diagnose. Do not re-run without fixing the root cause.
- Components that combine multiple `useEffect` + `react-hook-form` `Controller` + `useWatch` (e.g. `DefaultSettings`) can hang in jsdom under full render. `vitest.config.ts` has `testTimeout: 10000` as a safety net — a timeout failure means the test setup needs fixing, not more retries.
- When mocking `fetch` in a component that fires multiple concurrent `useEffect` fetches (e.g. `GET /api/v1/settings` + `GET /api/v1/apps`), use URL-based dispatch (`mockImplementation((url) => {...})`) instead of `mockResolvedValueOnce` chains — call order is non-deterministic.

## HOW NOT

- Do not reintroduce the `next` package.
- Do not run as a standalone server — the relay serves it.
- Do not call the Agent directly from the dashboard — always go through the relay.
- Do not put platform-specific conditionals (`if platform === 'ios'`) in UI components.
- Do not send session recording data to external storage.

## Compound

### WebSocket Binary Frame Reception

**When**: receiving and rendering binary stream frames

**How**: `useRelay` receives binary frames (set `socket.binaryType = 'arraybuffer'`, else `e.data` is a `Blob`); `IOSViewer` / `AndroidViewer` render via a decoder chosen by `pickDecoder` (`lib/decoders/`) — WebCodecs on secure contexts, WASM (tinyh264) on plain HTTP, `createImageBitmap` for the JPEG fallback.

**Why** (not obvious from the code):
- Both H.264 tiers paint **straight to a canvas with no `<video>` media element** — WebCodecs decodes to a `VideoFrame`, WASM (tinyh264) decodes to I420 rendered by `YUVWebGLRenderer` — so there is no media-element buffer adding latency. H.264 is hardware-decoded (WebCodecs) on secure contexts; only the JPEG fallback is CPU-decoded (`createImageBitmap`).
- Release the GPU texture/frame every frame (`bitmap.close()` / `VideoFrame.close()`) — otherwise GPU memory leaks per frame.

## Accessibility rules (a11y-lens)

This package is the only one with DOM/client code, so the a11y-lens rules apply here. Staged UI changes are checked at commit time by the root lefthook `a11y-lens` job; findings with `error` severity block the commit.

When writing or modifying UI code (JSX/TSX/HTML), apply the rule set in `node_modules/@joduchan/a11y-lens/skills/a11y-lens/references/` — read the relevant category before implementing:

- `01-landmarks-headings.md` — document outline, one h1, no level skips, labelled landmarks
- `02-images-alt.md` — alt text that describes function in context; icon-only controls need accessible names
- `03-forms-labels.md` — placeholder is not a label; errors tied via `aria-describedby`; name matches visible label
- `04-aria-widgets.md` — prefer native elements; custom widgets implement the complete WAI-ARIA APG pattern
- `05-keyboard-interaction.md` — full APG key sets, no hover-only affordances, no keyboard traps
- `06-focus-management.md` — overlays move and return focus; async results are announced via live regions

Tip: agents with skills support get richer guidance via `npx skills add jo-duchan/a11y-lens`.

Self-check against these categories before finishing any UI task — it is cheaper than failing the pre-commit gate.
