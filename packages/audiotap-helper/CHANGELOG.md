### Minor Changes

- 6bd8ebe: Symmetric host-mute for Android (#341): the emulator's audio no longer leaks to the agent Mac's speakers.

  The macOS Core Audio process-tap helper is now a shared package, `@tapflowio/audiotap-helper` (moved out of `ios-agent`), used by both platforms — so android-agent depending on it is a clean direction (no cross-platform-agent dependency). On macOS 14.2+, android-agent holds a **mute-only** `.muted` tap on the emulator's qemu process, silencing its host output while gRPC keeps capturing for the browser — matching iOS's `muteBehavior=.muted`. The helper self-exits when qemu dies; below 14.2 / non-macOS it's a no-op (fall back to the Mac's volume). `tapflow agent start` / `start` now also prime the audio-capture permission when Android is selected.

  `ios-agent` keeps the same public API (`requestAudioPermission`/`isAudioSupported` are re-exported from the shared package); only the helper's internal location changed.

### Patch Changes

- 3377bfe: Fix the package type entrypoint for npm consumers (#345). `exports.types` now points at the published `dist/*.d.ts` instead of `src/` — which isn't shipped in the tarball (`files` ships only `dist`/`bin`), so consumers couldn't resolve the package's types.

  The monorepo moves to **TypeScript project references** (each lib package gets `composite: true` + `references`, plus a root solution `tsconfig.json`). `typecheck`/`build` run via `tsc -b`, so workspace typecheck stays build-light (incremental, no manual dist build) while the published packages expose correct types from `dist`. No runtime or public API changes.
