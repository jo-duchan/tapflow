# Roadmap

> Live tracking → [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/jo-duchan/projects/1)
> Why we build this way → [VISION.md](./VISION.md)

tapflow is currently at `v0.x`. The roadmap below reflects the path to a stable `v1.0.0`.
Breaking changes may appear in minor versions until `v1.0.0` is tagged.

**How to read this file.** ROADMAP.md owns *direction* — the phases, what each one is for,
version goals, and what is out of scope. The *live status* of individual work items lives in
[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/jo-duchan/projects/1) and the linked issues. Completed
foundation phases are kept as a checked record; active phases list their issues so the issue/board
stays the single source of truth.

## The three QA axes

tapflow is one QA workflow used from three starting points, all sharing the same session, app, and runtime (see [VISION.md](./VISION.md) for the why).

- **Manual QA** — the browser dashboard: the team tests by hand on a real simulator or emulator. Shipping today (Phases 1–4).
- **AI Automation** — the deterministic flow runner (`tapflow flow run`) and the MCP server for LLM agents. Shipping today (Phase 5 foundation).
- **Manual ↔ AI bridge** — turning a manual session into a replayable flow. Today an agent can author a flow by demonstrating it through the MCP tools. The larger goal is **Flow Capture**: a person operates the app in the dashboard and tapflow records the actions as tree-based selectors, no agent required (Phase 5+, not built yet).

The bridge (especially Flow Capture) is the differentiator — it drops the cost of turning manual QA into automation to nearly zero.

## Foundation — Phases 1–3 (complete)

The structural groundwork: a stable, well-tested, extensible base. These phases are done; kept
here as a record.

### Phase 1 — Stability `v0.1.0`

Critical bug fixes before the first public release.

- [x] Graceful child process shutdown — register `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers to call `agent.disconnect()`, preventing zombie processes for `touch-helper`, `keyboard-helper`, and `scrcpy`
- [x] `ScreenCaptureStreamer`: send `SIGTERM` first → wait 1s → `SIGKILL`
- [x] `ScrcpySession.start()`: wrap server process in try-finally to guarantee cleanup on error
- [x] `RelayServer.stop()`: call `clearInterval` for `purgeExpiredRecordings` and `flushResourceBuffers`

### Phase 2 — Quality `v0.2.0`

Developer experience and reliability. `v0.2.0` drops the `-alpha` suffix.

- [x] Pre-commit hooks — Lefthook with lint + typecheck on staged files
- [x] `logger.ts` abstraction — replace 66 direct `console.log/error` calls with a leveled logger
- [x] Custom error classes — `ValidationError`, `PlatformError`, `AuthError`
- [x] CLI smoke tests — `--version`, `--help` subprocess smoke tests via tsx
- [x] Zod-based config validation — catch `NaN` and invalid values at startup
- [x] Migration atomic transactions — wrap all migrations in `db.transaction()`
- [x] Coordinate transform unit tests — normalize (0–1), landscape rotation, display scale, bezel offset
- [x] `touch-helper` stdin protocol snapshot tests — lock byte layout to spec

### Phase 3 — Ecosystem `v0.3.0`

Scalability, extensibility, and CI/CD integration.

- [x] WebSocket backpressure — check `ws.bufferedAmount` before sending frames; drop or queue for slow clients
- [x] Runtime platform registration — dynamic registry so new platforms need zero changes to `agent-core`, CLI, or Dashboard
- [x] PAT scope enforcement — apply `scope` checks consistently across all endpoints
- [x] CI/CD integration guide — upload `.app.zip` / `.apk` via REST API from CI → view in the dashboard

---

## Phase 4 — Experience (DX + UX) `v0.4.0`

Polish the **primary path**: a team opens a browser and tests on a real simulator/emulator with
no friction. This is tapflow's core value, so it comes first.

### UX — browser testing experience

The people who test (PO, PM, designers, QA). The headline is **low-latency streaming**: operating
the simulator/emulator in the browser should feel nearly as direct as touching it locally
(tier1 north star). Most recent work has driven this — H.264 + WebCodecs/WASM, relay
drop-to-keyframe — and it continues here.

- [#102](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/102) — streaming performance improvements (encoding + transport)
- [#195](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/195) — optimize capture cadence + touch input path
- [#202](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/202) — iOS session recording at native resolution (match Android fidelity)
- [#156](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/156) — evaluate WebTransport for relay→browser streaming
- [#153](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/153) — app log viewer in the QA session

### DX — self-hosting & contributor experience

The people who install, operate, and contribute. Make setup, diagnosis, and operations smooth.

## Phase 5 — Agent Experience (AX) `v0.5.0` and beyond

tapflow has two QA axes. The browser dashboard is the **manual QA axis**: the whole team tests by
hand, no setup required. The MCP path is the **automated QA axis**: its main stage is CI/CD. Both
axes share the same session infrastructure (relay, agents, dashboard observation); the automated
axis is opt-in and never affects the manual path.

The guiding principle for the automated axis: **an LLM is involved only at authoring time — replay
is deterministic.** Agents explore the app through MCP tools and generate flow files; CI replays
those flows with zero LLM calls, which keeps runs idempotent and API cost at zero. Flow files are
a generated artifact, not a language users must learn.

The foundation already exists (`@tapflowio/mcp-server` with MCP tools, plus the screenshot REST
endpoint); Phase 5 builds on top.

- [x] Screenshot REST endpoint — `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/screenshot` for programmatic capture
- [x] `@tapflowio/mcp-server` — LLM-driven simulator control via MCP tools
- [#133](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/133) — UI accessibility tree query (`query_ui_tree`) — unified element schema with normalized frames, so agents tap by element instead of guessing coordinates
- [ ] Deterministic YAML flow format + headless CLI runner — state reset and condition-based waits built in, JUnit report + failure screenshots, no LLM at replay time
- [ ] `run_flow` MCP tool — agents replay verified flows through the same deterministic engine
- [ ] **Flow Capture** (the manual↔AI bridge) — a person operates the app in the dashboard; tapflow records the actions as tree-based selectors and drafts a YAML flow, no agent required. Selector-based (via the UI tree), not coordinate recording, so captures stay robust. After the runner ships.

## Phase 5+ / Not yet scheduled

Larger tracks that fit tapflow's mission but are not yet committed to a version.

- **Physical device connection** — stream and control real, USB-connected devices alongside simulators/emulators
  - [#152](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/152) — physical device connection (umbrella)
  - [#150](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/150) — physical device connection — iOS
  - [#151](https://github.com/jo-duchan/tapflow/issues/151) — physical device connection — Android

---

## Not planned

The following are out of scope for tapflow's core mission ("browser-based simulator control, data on-premises"):

- **External automation framework integration (WebDriverAgent, Appium, Selenium)** — the automated QA axis is served by tapflow's own minimal, deterministic flow runner (Phase 5); wiring in external drivers is not planned
- **Cloud hosting / SaaS mode** — tapflow is self-hosted by design
- **Video streaming via WebRTC** — DataChannel instability and lack of P2P benefit in a relay-intermediary architecture make this a net negative
