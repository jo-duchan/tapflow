# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- android: screen rotation on Android 15+ (API 35+). `AdbWrapper.setRotation` now uses `wm user-rotation lock` instead of the legacy `settings put system user_rotation`, which newer Android silently ignores (only a rotation suggestion appears). The bundled scrcpy server is upgraded 3.1 → 3.3, fixing the locked capture-orientation direction (scrcpy #6010) that left the stream sideways after rotation. Verified on API 34 and API 36 emulators.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- H.264 streaming pipeline: iOS streams H.264 by default via a VideoToolbox encoder, cutting bandwidth ~10× vs JPEG (~16–27 KB/frame vs ~235 KB) for noticeably lower latency. Android streaming moves to a runtime decoder layer.
- Automatic codec negotiation: the browser advertises its decode capability (`acceptH264`) at boot; the agent picks H.264 only when the client can decode it, otherwise falls back to JPEG — no black screens on older browsers. Opt out with `TAPFLOW_IOS_CODEC=jpeg`.
- Tiered browser decoders: HTTPS → WebCodecs, plain-HTTP LAN → WASM (tinyh264), both WebGL2-rendered.
- cli: `tapflow start` prints the public tunnel URL banner (Tailscale MagicDNS host / tailnet IP auto-detected); a missing rathole token now falls back to local-only instead of exiting.
- dashboard: 404 error page and rectangular auth submit button.

### Changed

- envelope: codec/keyframe marker added to the frame header (byte5 flags). Backward compatible — older clients read frames as JPEG and the relay forwards payloads untouched; agents without `acceptH264` (version skew) default to JPEG.
- ios-agent: lower the default JPEG stream quality `0.95` → `0.8`, cutting iOS frame bandwidth ~40% on idle/simple screens to reduce relay→browser frame drops on LAN. Tune with the `TAPFLOW_JPEG_QUALITY` env var (`0`–`1`).

### Fixed

- android: landscape rotation and recording via a locked stream + local intent.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-01

### Security

- relay: fix path traversal in `/uploads/` — `serveUpload` now validates that the resolved file path stays within `uploadsDir`; requests that escape the directory return 403.
- relay: `/uploads/` route now requires view authentication — unauthenticated requests return 401 before file serving.
- relay: WebSocket connections from non-localhost clients without a valid JWT cookie or PAT are rejected with close code 1008.
- relay: WebSocket role gating — browser-role sockets that send agent-only messages (`agent:register`, `agent:resources`, etc.) are disconnected immediately.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

### Breaking Changes

- `tapflow init` no longer creates an admin account. It now scaffolds `tapflow.config.json`.
  - **Before:** `tapflow start` (auto-created config) → `tapflow init` (admin creation via CLI)
  - **After:** `tapflow init` (scaffold config) → `tapflow start` → open `/setup` in browser (admin creation)
  - **Migrate:** use the `/setup` page on first launch, or `tapflow admin init` in headless environments.
- `tapflow start` and `tapflow relay start` no longer create `tapflow.config.json` as a side effect. Run `tapflow init` explicitly, or skip it to use built-in defaults (port 4000, `.tapflow-data/`).

### Added

- `tapflow init` — scaffold `tapflow.config.json` interactively; `--tunnel tailscale|rathole` for non-interactive mode; `--force` to overwrite.
- `tapflow init` auto-updates `.gitignore` — creates the file if absent, appends `.tapflow-data/` if not already present.
- `tapflow admin init` — create the first admin account via CLI (headless / CI fallback).
- Dashboard `/setup` page — web-based first admin account creation; auto-redirected from `/login` when no accounts exist.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/status` — public endpoint returning `{ initialized: boolean }`.
- Tailscale tunnel provider (`tunnel.provider: "tailscale"`) — E2E encrypted, no VPS required.

### Removed

- Automatic `tapflow.config.json` creation as a side effect of `tapflow start` / `tapflow relay start`.
