## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- cli: `tapflow setup [platform]` — guided, one-pass environment setup. Auto-detects platforms when run without an argument. iOS opens the App Store for Xcode, activates it (license / first-launch), and downloads a simulator runtime. Android installs a JDK and builds a self-contained SDK at `~/Library/Android/sdk` (command-line tools, platform-tools, emulator, system image — no Android Studio GUI), then creates a set of AVDs across form factors. Booting stays on-demand via the relay.
- cli: `tapflow doctor [platform]` — checks a single platform or all. iOS shows Xcode / simctl / Simulator; Android shows SDK / adb / AVD (symmetric). `--json` emits machine-readable output; a device/AVD only needs to exist, not be running.

### Changed

- cli: `doctor` reports a missing prerequisite as a failure consistently across iOS and Android, and no longer triggers the macOS Command Line Tools install popup on a machine without Xcode.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- android: emulators now capture over gRPC and encode H.264 on the Mac host (VideoToolbox). The gRPC backend is the default for emulators (auto-detected, 30fps cap), with automatic scrcpy fallback; real devices continue to use scrcpy.
- streaming: unified per-session downscale. Resolution is chosen from the viewer's connection context — native on a secure context, 1280px on LAN-HTTP, 1000px external — and is tunable via `TAPFLOW_MAX_SIZE` and the per-platform / `_LAN` / `_EXTERNAL` overrides.
- relay: request an IDR keyframe when a browser (re)joins a booted device, so a late joiner paints immediately.

### Changed

- dashboard: iOS/Android decoding and perf telemetry are unified behind a single `useDecoderStream` hook (hardware WebCodecs on a secure context, WASM fallback otherwise).
- ios-agent: static-frame skip — unchanged H.264 frames are no longer re-sent.

### Fixed

- ios: tear-free framebuffer snapshots via a seed-stable copy, and keyframe-aware backpressure on the agent→relay stream.
- android: keyframe-aware backpressure on the agent→relay stream, and 16-aligned encode sizing to avoid macroblock padding on the WASM decoder.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- android: fix a crash when the scrcpy video stream is cancelled. The v0.6.0 socket-close cleanup could call `close()`/`error()` on an already-closed stream controller, throwing inside the socket event handler.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- android: opt-in stream throughput metrics (`TAPFLOW_STREAM_METRICS=1`) logging fps / KB·s / drop every 5s, matching the iOS agent.
- agents: hold a macOS power assertion (`caffeinate -i`) while connected so an unattended/idle Mac doesn't throttle the simulator/emulator. macOS-only; no-op elsewhere.

### Changed

- android: H.264 frames now carry the codec/keyframe flags in the stream envelope, so the relay's keyframe-aware backpressure drops to the next keyframe under LAN congestion instead of forwarding P-frames that tear. (scrcpy `send_frame_meta=true`; the public `stream()` contract is unchanged.)
- android: on-demand IDR recovery — `stream:request-idr` now resets the scrcpy encoder (RESET_VIDEO), resyncing fast instead of waiting for the periodic IDR (parity with iOS).

### Fixed

- android: the scrcpy stream now terminates on socket close, so the agent's pump and its timers no longer leak after a device shuts down.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- android: screen rotation on Android 15+ (API 35+). `AdbWrapper.setRotation` now uses `wm user-rotation lock` instead of the legacy `settings put system user_rotation`, which newer Android silently ignores (only a rotation suggestion appears). The bundled scrcpy server is upgraded 3.1 → 3.3, fixing the locked capture-orientation direction (scrcpy #6010) that left the stream sideways after rotation. Verified on API 34 and API 36 emulators.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- H.264 streaming pipeline: iOS streams H.264 by default via a VideoToolbox encoder, cutting bandwidth ~10× vs JPEG (~16–27 KB/frame vs ~235 KB) for noticeably lower latency. Android streaming moves to a runtime decoder layer.
- Automatic codec negotiation: the browser advertises its decode capability (`acceptH264`) at boot; the agent picks H.264 only when the client can decode it, otherwise falls back to JPEG — no black screens on older browsers. Opt out with `TAPFLOW_IOS_CODEC=jpeg`.
- Tiered browser decoders: HTTPS → WebCodecs, plain-HTTP LAN → WASM (tinyh264), both WebGL2-rendered.
- cli: `tapflow start` prints the public tunnel URL banner (Tailscale MagicDNS host / tailnet IP auto-detected); a missing rathole token now falls back to local-only instead of exiting.
- dashboard: 404 error page and rectangular auth submit button.

### Changed

- envelope: codec/keyframe marker added to the frame header (byte5 flags). Backward compatible — older clients read frames as JPEG and the relay forwards payloads untouched; agents without `acceptH264` (version skew) default to JPEG.
- ios-agent: lower the default JPEG stream quality `0.95` → `0.8`, cutting iOS frame bandwidth ~40% on idle/simple screens to reduce relay→browser frame drops on LAN. Tune with the `TAPFLOW_JPEG_QUALITY` env var (`0`–`1`).

### Fixed

- android: landscape rotation and recording via a locked stream + local intent.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-01

### Security

- relay: fix path traversal in `/uploads/` — `serveUpload` now validates that the resolved file path stays within `uploadsDir`; requests that escape the directory return 403.
- relay: `/uploads/` route now requires view authentication — unauthenticated requests return 401 before file serving.
- relay: WebSocket connections from non-localhost clients without a valid JWT cookie or PAT are rejected with close code 1008.
- relay: WebSocket role gating — browser-role sockets that send agent-only messages (`agent:register`, `agent:resources`, etc.) are disconnected immediately.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

### Breaking Changes

- `tapflow init` no longer creates an admin account. It now scaffolds `tapflow.config.json`.
  - **Before:** `tapflow start` (auto-created config) → `tapflow init` (admin creation via CLI)
  - **After:** `tapflow init` (scaffold config) → `tapflow start` → open `/setup` in browser (admin creation)
  - **Migrate:** use the `/setup` page on first launch, or `tapflow admin init` in headless environments.
- `tapflow start` and `tapflow relay start` no longer create `tapflow.config.json` as a side effect. Run `tapflow init` explicitly, or skip it to use built-in defaults (port 4000, `.tapflow-data/`).

### Added

- `tapflow init` — scaffold `tapflow.config.json` interactively; `--tunnel tailscale|rathole` for non-interactive mode; `--force` to overwrite.
- `tapflow init` auto-updates `.gitignore` — creates the file if absent, appends `.tapflow-data/` if not already present.
- `tapflow admin init` — create the first admin account via CLI (headless / CI fallback).
- Dashboard `/setup` page — web-based first admin account creation; auto-redirected from `/login` when no accounts exist.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/status` — public endpoint returning `{ initialized: boolean }`.
- Tailscale tunnel provider (`tunnel.provider: "tailscale"`) — E2E encrypted, no VPS required.

### Removed

- Automatic `tapflow.config.json` creation as a side effect of `tapflow start` / `tapflow relay start`.
